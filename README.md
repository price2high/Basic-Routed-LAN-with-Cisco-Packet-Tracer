### 📌 Project Title:
**Small Office Network with Two Subnets and Secured Access**

---

### 🎯 Objective:
Design and configure a small office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consists of two separate subnets connected via a central router, each with its own switch and set of PCs. The project includes IP configuration, securing access to network devices, and testing connectivity.
